# Collection of codes and scripts for small projects
** THIS REPO HAS BEEN MERGED INTO MISC **

**_Zhan Li_**

These projects in the subfolders are very short-term or temporary. Each folder is a collection of codes and/or scripts that will not become a standalone repository to maintain but are worthy to be organized together. These codes and scripts in a subfolder are mostly of only interest to this particular project but not to any other party. But as things evolve, a project here can become larger and more useful and grow into a standalone repository worthy of long-term maintainance and sharing with other parties.
